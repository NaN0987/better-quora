# Better Quora
A google chrome extension designed to make Quora's website easier to use by removing ads, showing question details (if available), and setting the theme to dark mode (can be changed in settings).

## Current features
- Removes ads that appear on the right side of the screen
- Removes ads under the question header
- Removes "Promoted" questions
- Removes "sponsered" posts that appear when you click "read more"
- Removes "Related Questions" boxes from feed
- Setting Quora to dark mode by default (can be changed in settings)
- Removes "please sign in to continue" popup, which can appear while browsing the site
- Adds a "comments" button to the question that shows how many questions there are
- Adds question details (if available):
  - All comments from the Quora Question Details Bot and the original poster will appear under the question title
- Optional features:
  - Removing the AI response that appears under questions
  - Having the main signup page (www.quora.com) redirect you to the search page (www.quora.com/search?q=%00)

## Planned features
- Optional features:
  - Include an option to turn off scraping the comments section (which would reduce lag for those on lower end systems)
- Make Quora Plus questions easier to read by removing the fade out (and look into getting around the Quora plus block by removing cookies)
- Add a button under Quora Plus questions to view the question in incognito mode (thus bypassing the paywall)
- Compatibility:
  - Mobile support (currently does not work on mobile)
  - Support for those who are logged into a quora account (not tested)
- Allow those not signed in to see the comments on answers (not sure if this is possible)
- Make the search bar work better by automatically reloading the page (needs testing)
